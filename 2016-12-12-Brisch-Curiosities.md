I have read throughout my week about arrests in Alexnderia. It was interesting to see that many people actually got into trouble for a variety of things. The main ones that I have seen was robbery. They have vaired from in home robberies to stealing things from the market places. I wonder why so many people were stealing things, did they not have the money to buy the things they stole. There also are various other crimes that are committed in the city but most are rare compared to robberies.
