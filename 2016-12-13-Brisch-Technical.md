Write your body text here.
I've had many technical problems during this course. I will be the first to admit that i am not expert on computers. There are many programs that i have no idea how to work. I've tried using the program atom adn i do not understand the functions within the application. I have no idea what parts of the program i dont need to use and what parts are important for converting my images to text files. This makes it very diffcult to complete much of the work in the course. 
If you wish to include a second image (other than your main image, which you indicate in the header), insert a reference in the following format into the body of your post:
